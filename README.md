# Object-Creation
In this section I am working on creating objects and assigning them their properties and methods.
I also work on having nested objects (objects within objects) and calling those object methods
from within the outermost object (ex: backpack.wallet.money or backpack["wallet"]["money"])

From this exercise I also learned from the console that there is always a request for a favicon
which is the icon that appears on the website's tab. I chose to go with a smiling seal since I'm
not working with a real webpage, but I'm definitely going to apply this to a portfolio website or
any other site I make as a free-agent
